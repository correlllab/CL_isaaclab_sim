In this directories lies a H12 robot asset w/ the realsense asset fixed to each of its hands, as well as the realsense asset. The way I fixed the realsense asset to the hands was kinda jank-I just went into Isaac Sim, made each asset a child of each hand's base, and applied a transform(same to both sides). My transform is NOT accurate and has NOT been measured on the real robot yet, but when the cameras are reattached to the physical robots hands, I'll make sure to get a measurement of the camera transforms to update my assets.
